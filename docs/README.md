This is a fork of [gruntwork.io/terraform-google-gke](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-gke). It is used for hosting a [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) cluster on [gke](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) in support of a research laboratory that uses [jupyterhub](https://jupyter.org/hub) for model construction and data analysis.
